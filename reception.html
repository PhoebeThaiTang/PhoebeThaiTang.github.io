	  <h3>Criticisms</h3>
	  <p>Corporate Memphis is the reigning art style in the fintech and property sectors. IPO-level companies prefer how politically “safe” Corporate Memphis is, while smaller-scale ones benefit from its “big-corp” branding and relative inexpensiveness.</p>
	  <p>Corporate Memphis’s oversaturation and exclusive association with the corporate world are the two main reasons why it generates so much backlash.</p>
	  <p>From the consumers’ point of view, the style is generic, overused, and appears to be an attempt at sanitizing public perception by presenting human interaction in utopian optimism. Put succinctly by Claire L.Evans, Corporate Memphis “makes big tech companies look friendly, approachable, and concerned with human-level interaction and community – which is largely the opposite of what they really are.” Or according to influential designer David Rudnick,“It depicts a world whose problems are already solved, built out of complementary components. It's a deliberate oversimplification.”</p>

	  <p>From a design point of view, Corporate Memphis has contributed to the homogenization of the Internet art culture. According to writer Rosie Samuels, “the impact of this practice is real and has successfully promoted the idea of a monolithic style washing over the industry.” Within flat art itself is a multitude of sub-categories and Corporate Memphis is one of them; however,        the domination of Corporate Memphis in the media has reduced flat art to a synonymous term and contributed to the “dulling” of the Internet art scene.</p>
	  <p>From an artistic point of view, to some, Corporate Memphis represents “lazy art” and  lack of creativity, while to others, it ironically evokes a form of corporate exploitation, as artists of this genre are rarely fully credited nor compensated. In the art world where originality is almost always a measurement of artistic ability, Corporate Memphis’s ubiquity and stylistically simple nature rule out any grounds for personal interpretation and branding. At the same time, once again due its technical simplicity, corporates can always hire other artists to replicate certain artists’ work.</p>

		<h3>Is it really that bad?</h3>
		<p>Freelance illustrator and self-titled “flat art apologist” Michele Rosenthal says no. In her words, “No art style is inherently corporate, because that describes how the illustrations are used, not how they look. It's not the fault of talented illustrators that capitalism has co-opted an appealing and popular style for its own propaganda. That's what capitalism does.” Rosenthal supports her argument with an ad for Coca-Cola featuring a realistic art style.</p>

		<p>On this topic, writer Rosie Samuels contends “By describing this particular assemblage of visual forms, color and content as “corporate,” we drew a line around it, enclosing the “corporateness” within recognizable boundaries. In doing so, we felt reassured that as long as our work does not look like that, as long as we do not work for Big Tech, we are safe from “corporateness” and neoliberalism. But if I make watercolor paintings for The New Yorker (i.e., Condé Nast), am I less of a “corporate” artist? If I create pencil drawings for Starbucks, do I participate less in capitalism? Reducing these complex systems into a single style is certainly naive, and self-righteously judging our peers only exacerbates the issue."</p>
