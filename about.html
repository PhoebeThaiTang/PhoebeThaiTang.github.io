			<h3>What is Corporate Memphis?</h3>
			<p>Corporate Memphis connotes a hyper-simplistic, flat, geometric and solid-colored  illustration style. It usually depicts cartoony human figures in action, with disproportionate anatomy such as long bendy limbs, minimal facial features, and strange skin color. This nondescript art style can be seen almost anywhere today, from train stations, to delivery services, to fintech companies.</p>
			<p>The name “Corporate Memphis” is a direct reference to Memphis - a post-modern style from the 80s created by Italian designers who called themselves “The Memphis Group.” Memphis is best described as “<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Collectors-give-80s-postmodernist-design-2nd-look-2517937.php" class="link3">a riot of color and materials that often overwhelmed a piece’s original intent, a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price.</a>” In fact, it is believed  to be the result of a creativity spurt from the Memphis Group after a drunken night of furniture sketches. As Corporate Memphis’ predecessor, Memphis is toy-like and childlike: it prioritizes clean shapes, bold and vibrant colors.</p>
			<p>As more and more companies opt for this type of illustration, “Memphis” takes on the prefix “Corporate,” and with that, Corporate Memphis was born. While musician and writer Claire L. Evans’s collection of flat art designs in 2018 helped popularize the style, it was actually Mike Merrill, an advertising expert, who first coined the term.</p>

			<h3>And why should anyone care?</h3>

			<br>
			<p>Because it is literally everywhere! Corporate Mephis registers in everyone’s mind, whether consciously or unconsciously.</p>
			<p>It must be noted that Corporate Memphis is by no means a formal design style — it’s more of a cynical, even mocking, term. Some of the critiques range from how artists of this genre are rarely credited, how it is monopolizing the Internet art culture, to how the limited color palette and lack of depth depict an unrealistically utopian world.</p>
			<p>And even more disturbingly, to some, Corporate Memphis represents “a desperate, desperate attempt at trying to be human.”</p>
