	<h3>A quick history</h3>
	<p>While it is established that Corporate Memphis originated from the 80s Memphis style, as freelance vector illustrator Michele Rosenthal pointed out, the flat art concept of which Corporate Memphis is an embodiment boasts a long and rich history. Flat art dates as far back as cave paintings, flourished in the late 19th century with the birth of Modernism, and experienced   profound changes during the early 2000s thanks to the advent of computers and the introduction of vector art. From 2000 to 2010, modern flat art grew into its own style and became increasingly popular thanks to the Dribble - a “social media” site for digital artists. However, it was not until Apple’s adoption of this art style in 2013 that flat art skyrocketed in popularity and became Corporate Memphis as we know it today</p>
	<p>With the rise of Corporate Memphis came the death of skeuomorphism, an aesthetic rooted in realism. As this style became increasingly user-unfriendly, Apple made the decision to change to a flattened user interface. The tech industry soon followed suit. According to Pablo Stanley, a Mexico City-based illustrator, “Tech firms adapted their UI systems to embrace the idea of flat design, and illustrations followed.”</p>

	<p>Stanley points out that it is the highly accessible and vast image banks for vector graphics that Corporate Memphis is able to take over the online illustration industry so quickly. As the owner of a free flat design database himself, Stanley estimates that his flat cartoons have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times by people and tech companies around the world. Other digital banks such as FreePik, UnDraw, and Adobe’s own vector art library, have played an essential role in the proliferation of Corporate Memphis in the media domain.</p>
	<p>Around 2017, in partnership with a design agency named BUCK, Facebook launched its own version of Corporate Memphis titled "Alegria", which means "joy" in Spanish. For Alegria,  flexibility is its biggest strength. Its exaggerated body shapes and odd choice of colors for skin tone is a deliberate attempt to pre-emptively eliminate any representation issues. After all, if nobody is represented, nobody is being discriminated against. </p>

	<h3>What about now?</h3>
	<p>In recent years, there is an explosion of articles and Youtube videos discussing (and dissing) this style. Many argue Corporate Memphis is on the decline, some declare it dead, and a significant portion of netizens make memes out of it. Will Corporate Memphis end up like skeuomorphism? How long will it take Corporate Memphis to truly die out? What will happen next?</p>
